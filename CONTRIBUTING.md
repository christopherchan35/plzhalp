# Agreements Thing

An outline on our agreements on pull request workflow, code review workflow, including who merges pull requests, and code styles.

## Pull Request Workflow

* opposite pair merges other pair's pull request
* everyone pulls whenever a merge is made
* descriptive commit messages (not "IT WORKS" or "WE'RE DONE" or "THE THING, IT'S LIT")

## Code Style

* refer to [AirBnB Ruby Style Guide](http://github.com/airbnb/ruby)
* write comments where there is potential for confusion
